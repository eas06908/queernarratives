 <h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue;">What is your relationship to video games? Do you play them? What kinds?<br>

</h1>

<h1 style="background-color:#73C2FB;">

In the begining I had zero relationships to video games and did not play them. I still would say I do not play video games but I can now relate to them more in the sense that anyone and everyone can make one and there is a game out there for pretty much everyone. <br></h1>

 What is important to you? What should we know about you? <br>

Family and friends are very important to me. Making sure people always know they can count on me and I'm always open to talk is also something a value a ton. This is something that will always hold true to me despite changes in my life. Everyone comes from different backgrounds and experiences and knowing there you have someone to listen despite maybe having a difference experince is important.<br>

 <h1 style="background-color:MediumSeaGreen;">Why are you taking this course? Why did you choose this one? <br>

</h1>
 <h1 style="background-color:#D0F0C0;">

I am honestly taking this course because it was the only one available when I was registering. After taking this course I can add that it opened and expanded my knowledge in the video game world. Creating video games and other websites is a unique idea to express yourself and share a story maybe other individuals can relate to. <br></h1>

<h1 style="background-color:Orange;">What do you think "queer games" are? (final reflection) <br>

  </h1>
<h1 style="background-color:#fee3c1;">
Queer games overall is a concept that has stuck with me over the semester. At first I had no idea what to expect, but queer games provide an open space for individuals to express their ideas and personal experiences for others to relate to. There are no set parameters for what a queer game has to look like or how it should function. A queer game could be a game created by an individual of any gender or identity but it helps them to share a vulnerable idea. Creating a space to be vulnerable is not the easiest experience and within queer games sticking with me as a whole, this idea of vulnerability within queer games is by far the most prominent aspect. Each project and game that I have created told a different story and allowed me to express and share different things in a form other than just text or verbal words. It is important to play these queer games to expand our experiences and step out of our comfort zones once again creating a vulnerable environment. We learn from our experiences and grow from them, and the more we step outside our comfort zone the more we are able to experience these new things. Queer games are overall a place where vulnerability exists.  </h1>
